## Resource List

This Resource List provides you with documentation and links to different activities for your CCBT Practicum. It's important to remember that a practicum is meant to be very interactive, focusing on hands-on activities and discussions afterwards.

## Purpose

The purpose of CCBT practicums is to help everyone involved in Bible translation understand and connect with the principles of church-centric Bible translation on a deep level, both in their thinking and emotions. The activities in this resource list are designed to foster unity and agreement among team members and between different teams working on Bible translation projects.

## Method

In practicum sessions, the focus is on active participation from the participants. You will have the opportunity to talk and share your thoughts in small groups and when reporting to the larger group. Your role as a facilitator is to:

- Clearly explain the instructions for each activity
- Keep an eye on the progress of the small groups to ensure they are following the instructions correctly
- Resolve any questions or conflicts that may arise within or between groups
- Lead the discussions after the activities and make sure important learning points are captured.

## About this Resource List


This resource list provides a selection of recommended activities for your practicum. Your role is to decide which sessions are most suitable for your group. To determine the best sessions for your team's effectiveness in Bible translation, you can use the Alignment Analysis tool provided with each session. Additionally, there are other helpful tools available, such as Simplified Needs Analysis, Missional translation brief, SWOT Analysis, and more, to assist you in making this decision.


To decide if your group should participate in a session, use the checklists in the Alignment Analysis sections. If your group has more checks in the "What We Would See Negative" column than in the "What We Would See Positive" column, it would be beneficial for them to take part in that session. 

**Please remember that the facilitator guides have links to other documents you need to review in order to successfully complete each practicum session.**
