## Session Focus

We are currently in a time of fast and sometimes unpredictable changes. To successfully navigate these changes, our organization must be able to respond with creative solutions. These solutions allow us to incorporate or adapt to new innovations in unexpected ways. The key to achieving this is by promoting a culture that encourages innovation and unconventional thinking. In this session, we will explore methods to introduce creative solutions into the translation process.
