## Session Focus

In this session, groups will document the steps they follow in their Bible translation process, identify where responsibilities are transferred between individuals or teams, and identify any gaps or areas that need improvement. They will also be encouraged to think beyond the specific task of Bible translation and consider the purpose of having a Bible and how it can be used to help believers grow in their faith.
