## Session Focus

Translating the Bible requires creating a reliable text and gaining the trust of the church network in the target language group. However, Gateway Language teams have sometimes questioned the reliability of unfoldingWord's Greek and Hebrew texts, as well as the ULT and UST translation tools. GL trainers need to convince church networks to trust these tools.

In this session, participants will learn about the tools used by unfoldingWord. The goal is to help them understand the concepts of trustworthy and trusted.
