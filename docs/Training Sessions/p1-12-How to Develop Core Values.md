## Session Focus

Every organization should have a shared set of values that guide its operations. When individuals join an organization, they bring their own set of values, which may not always align with everyone else's. This session aims to create a platform for identifying and establishing a common set of values for the organization. It will also explore strategies for effectively communicating and implementing these values as business practices.
