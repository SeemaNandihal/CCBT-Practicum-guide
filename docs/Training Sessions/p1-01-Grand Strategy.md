## Session Focus

In Church-Centric Bible Translation (CCBT), it is important for groups to appreciate the input of each team member and work together to create resources that align with theological principles. While there are different teams and individuals with specific roles, it's crucial for everyone to value the contributions of other teams and recognize their significance. Furthermore, they should cherish these contributions and prioritize relationships as being equally important as the outcomes they produce. The objective of this activity is for everyone to find ways to enhance cooperation within their own group and between different groups involved in the translation process.
