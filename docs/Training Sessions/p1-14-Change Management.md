## Session Focus

Two factors that resist change are entropy and inertia, which are concepts borrowed from physics. Entropy refers to the tendency for things to become more complex over time. Inertia, on the other hand, is the tendency for things to remain the same unless influenced by an external force. This session will explore strategies to overcome these forces and successfully implement change.
