## Session Focus

When people have the necessary tools, they can effectively complete their work. But what can they do if they don't have these tools? They have two options: they can wait for someone to provide them with the tools, or they can take the initiative to build their own tools and accomplish the task. This session aims to create enthusiasm for being part of the global development team that builds essential tools. It encourages individuals to be willing to explore, experiment, and test potentially risky technological options.
